# transfer_funds
A T-SQL stored procedure that performs funds transfers between accounts. I added some validations that were not part of the original requirements. The instructor liked my code and may incorporate some of it in future updates to course lectures.

I wrote this code as an exercise while taking an intermediate T-SQL course on Udemy. Code is presented AS IS, with no guarantee as to its suitability for any purpose whatsoever. User assumes all risks associated with running this code. (C) 2023 Adiv Abramson
